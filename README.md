## About This Project

The Meta-Curation Atlas is an image-based cartography that maps how the cloud motif transforms across digital archives—from theological mystery to scientific object to corporate metaphor. This project reclaims narrative agency in an age of algorithmic flattening, examining how meaning is constructed, filtered, and potentially recovered from database structures.

The cloud serves as our object of study because it spans heaven and hard drive, appearing in religious paintings, scientific illustrations, user interfaces, and marketing campaigns for data infrastructure. Its meaning shifts between the divine, the natural, and the technical—making it the perfect symbol to trace through digital cultural repositories.

## Methodology

This project operates through three interconnected methodological stages:

### 1. Data Mining (Automated Research)

Automated collection of cloud imagery from institutional repositories using APIs and web scraping, gathering both images and metadata from sources like:

- Rijksmuseum
- Getty Museum
- Harvard Art Museums
- Metropolitan Museum of Art
- Digital Public Library of America
- [View the complete list of sources](methodology/data_mining.md)

### 2. Data Organization (Visual Clustering)

Moving beyond metadata limitations, this stage clusters images based on visual similarity—form, color, texture, and composition—creating a taxonomy through visual language rather than textual classification.

### 3. Meta-Curation (Interpretive Framing)

The final stage introduces subjective interpretation, encompassing anything that evokes "cloudness"—from literal clouds to foam, wool, or vapor—connecting machine logic with human imagination and creating meaningful sequences and typologies.

## Conceptual Framework

This project exists between database and narrative, resisting the flattening tendencies of digital archives. Drawing inspiration from Aby Warburg's _Mnemosyne Atlas_, it uses juxtaposition to generate meaning and invite associative thinking.

As Wolfgang Ernst notes, digital archives don't "remember" in a human sense—they sort, tag, retrieve, and reassemble without reflection. This atlas attempts to reintroduce narrative depth to systems designed for logistical efficiency.

The digital museum no longer tells a story; it filters, tags, and retrieves. The archive has been flattened into a digital grid of thumbnails, whose value doesn't lie anymore in their historical resonance, context and story. In this context, meta-curation becomes a critical practice that can recover meaning and build new connections.

## Using This Repository

This repository contains:

1. **Methodology Tools**: Scripts and documentation for each stage of the process
